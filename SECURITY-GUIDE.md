# Security Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Fixes

The following security enhancements have been implemented in your application:

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Phone Number Validation**: Indian phone number format validation with regex
- **Email Validation**: Enhanced email format validation  
- **Name Validation**: Character restrictions and length limits
- **Enrollment Number Validation**: Format validation (2 digits + 2 letters + 3-4 digits)
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **File Upload Validation**: File type, size, and extension validation for images

### 2. Password Security
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with complexity rules
- **Password Strength Indicator**: Real-time strength assessment
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Secure password input handling

### 3. Authentication Security
- **Client-side Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation before submission

### 4. Database Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Admin-only access to student data
- **Security Definer Functions**: Secure role checking
- **Proper Data Access Control**: All sensitive operations restricted to admin users

## üîß Manual Configuration Required

You need to configure these settings in your Supabase dashboard:

### 1. Enable Leaked Password Protection
Navigate to: **Authentication > Settings > Security**
- ‚úÖ Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
- ‚úÖ Set minimum password length to 8 characters
- ‚úÖ Enable password complexity requirements

### 2. Configure Password Policies
In Supabase Dashboard > **Authentication > Settings > Security**:
```
Minimum password length: 8
Require uppercase: Yes
Require lowercase: Yes  
Require numbers: Yes
Require special characters: Yes
```

### 3. Set Up Proper Redirect URLs
Navigate to: **Authentication > URL Configuration**
- Set **Site URL** to your application URL
- Add your preview URL and deployed URL to **Redirect URLs**
- This prevents authentication redirect errors

### 4. Configure Rate Limiting (Optional)
For production environments, consider setting up:
- Failed login attempt limits
- IP-based rate limiting
- CAPTCHA for suspicious activities
